# Python Phishing Spammer

so basically one day my mom and me received a suspicious sms text, basically a spoof text and they are pretending that they are from the bank then there is a fake website with a fake login. I quickly wrote a python program which will flood the login form 

Just change the url and xpath of the selenium

- utilizes halo and selenium python packages
- need geckodriver for selenium: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
